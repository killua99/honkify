## What does Honkify do?

When activated by pressing the key "Y", all links and buttons on the site will stop working, instead triggering a “honk!” sound effect.

This is not transpiled and not tested on any browsers except Chrome latest and Firefox lasted, because this is a silly joke and therefore honk honk honk!

## Options

Honkify support 3 options to be a little flexible.

1) `get_option( 'goose_active', true )` An extra toggle to dynamic toggle the honk, think for pages that 100% you don't want the honk but others you do.
2) `get_option( 'goose_hotkey', 'y' )` Setup your custom hotkey to enable the honk!
3) `get_option( 'goose_loose', 'lock' )` Default value to determine whether the goose is lock or loose by default.
